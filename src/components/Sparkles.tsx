// can this become a react component?
// holds onto the props in its own state & useEffect re-renders when those props change
// app could be responsible just for passing down the mouse position and wouldn't need to hold state for that
// all the styling could go into a CSS file
// the positioning could become inline styling that interpolates in the x and y positions
// unmounting could be handled by using the ReactDOM.findDOMNode(component) that is on a timer and removes the found element after a half second
