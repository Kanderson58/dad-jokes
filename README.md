## Introduction
Welcome to âœ¨ZingerZâœ¨, a retro-themed web application created by a team of four passionate developers who have a soft spot for those *extra cheesy* 'dad jokes'.

âœ¨ZingerZâœ¨ allows users to enjoy a continuous stream of random jokes or search for a specific joke by entering keywords.

During this project, we challenged ourselves to self-teach and implement TypeScript into our development process for improved code organization and enhanced type safety. Our team utilized their newly acquired skills in TypeScript, React, and Router to create a seamless and responsive experience. Additionally, we conducted comprehensive user flow testing with Cypress to ensure that the app delivers a top-notch experience to all users.

Our jokes are easily accessible on any device, so you can take a break from reality and enjoy a good laugh anywhere, anytime. We hope âœ¨ZingerZâœ¨ adds a little humor to your day!
